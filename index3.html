    <img src="superman arch.png"><h1>Superman Archetypes</h1><p>These are the leading men of their own stories and the public definitely treats them as such. Super Strength, flight, speed and some sort of energy projection is their usual accesory. 
        And ncase you haven't noticed, they're all styled the same. 
        They even pose the same a lot. psst, and most of the time, look the same(Male, Casucasian). Of course, not all are heroes or share the same morality.

<div><img src="Vigilantes.PNG"></div><div><h1>Vigilantes</h1></div><div><p>These guys could be labeled heroes, anti-heroes. One thing is clear, they don't play by the rules. The law is in their hands as far as they and their fans are concerned. 
    However, Some go further than the others in what they're willing to do in other to achieve their goals. </p></div>

    <div><img src="billionaires.png"></div><div><h1>Billionaires</h1></div><div><p>While some folks can be born with superpowers or obtain them through freak scientific experiments/accidents, some guys just simply buy their way to such power. But don't let their money fool you.
        They may be rich and priviledged, but these guys are no punks. They're highly skilled in tech, martial arts and weaponry. Plus they're highly intelligent and emotionally tough, 
        even though they've usually endured a lot of trauma to get o where they are.</p></div>
<div>
   <div><img src="vixens.png"></div><div><h1>Vixens</h1></div><div><p>While female comic book characters are usually easy on the eyes, these lovely ladies can take it to a whole new level.
    Some can say that's one of their superpowers. Afterall, being sexy is one way to disarm a man. 
    Not that they need that, cos make no mistake, they kickass as good as the guys.</p></div>
